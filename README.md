# DrumsJS

It's a simple project which I've been using basics concepts of JavaScript language.

Concepts:

Basically the DrumsJS is an application which I`ve created with JavaScript basic concepts.  How`s it works:

- Each letter has a sound of Drum's part.
- When the user press whatever the key available in the options which we could see on the screen, a sound is gonna play.

- The input available below the letters has the functionally to create a sequence of sounds and then reproduce it. But it depends of the button click

- Finally the project is gonna excute the sequence of sounds which I`ve written through the blank.
